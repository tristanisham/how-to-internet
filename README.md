# how-to-internet
## Free, open source, guides on how to build everything designed for everyone.

<hr>

Hey there! My name is **[Tristan Isham](https://twitter.com/TristanIsham)** and I'm currently trying to develop "*how-to-internet*". 

When it comes to coding, I've come to realize that the hardest part is often learning it. That's why I want to create this project and open it up to everyone in the world to edit, remix, and make their own! Creating a hub, not only for people trying to code but for anyone who wants to learn how to make anything on the internet (videos/podcasts/webapps/languages/etc...) is just part of my goal to allow anyone to become a creator. It's a magical field to be a part of, why not help anyone join it!?

Currntly I'm just trying to build a beautiful, responsive, website for anyone to access, but eventually I'd love to start getting tutorial submissions and start making my own!

If you have any questions, hit me up on Twitter.
